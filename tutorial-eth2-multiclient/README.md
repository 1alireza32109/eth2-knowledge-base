This guide is designed for **non-technical** people. It focuses on **Windows10 and MacOs** and is an ongoing process, and it will be updated as we collect feedback and adapt to the most recent client changes!

Note: There are **multiple** ways to join the ETH2.0 Testnet by using different clients.

## **Requirements** 

* **Recommended:** 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD**,** [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/) **wallet installed**  
* **Minimum:** 4GB RAM, 20GB SSD**,** [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/) **wallet installed**

Before we start, it is recommended reading the [glossary](https://kb.beaconcha.in/glossary) but not a requirement.
