# Installing Docker on Windows Pro

#### **Installing Docker on Windows Pro**

**Step 0.**

Make sure you have [Windows10 Pro](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)**.**

**Step 1.**

[Download Docker](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe). Installing is different for everyone depending on the motherboard manufacturer. Entering BIOS may be required to change "virtualization" to "enabled". ****\(What is [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)?\)

You will need to have "[Virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)" enabled, which you can in the Taskmanager.

**Step 2.**

Change Docker File sharing settings - Manually create a folder called **"prysm"** in that specific directory. Picture below for clarification.
