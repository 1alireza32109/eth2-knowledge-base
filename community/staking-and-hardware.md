# Staking & Hardware

#### Q: Which hardware should I buy in order to run 5 validators as a beginner?

> 5 validators is a pretty good chunk of change \(and I think we all believe it is subject to grow\), so it makes a lot of sense to buy some nice hardware to use as it will pay for itself pretty quickly.

> These are a good option because, first of all, you can find them really cheap. And you get a bunch of other features like redundant power supplies in case one breaks, dual CPUs, so in the unlikely event one craps out on you, most of the time you can take out the bad one, move your ram sticks to the other socket and start it back up. You also get a proper hardware raid card so you can run redundant storage. [There is also cool monitoring and maintenance options that you don't get with consumer hardware.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out) Add in a battery backup, and you should have a super stable beast of a machine to make your attestations. Also, the most important reason to go this way is, it is way cooler than a laptop or a raspberry pi.

> Downsides are noise, and power consumption. These are loud little guys, but you can jam it in a closet somewhere and it shouldn't disturb you too much. The tower servers are quieter than rack-mount so it shouldn't be too bad. Power consumption will probably be around 100w while running your node and validator. So that'll be around 10 bucks a month, which your staking rewards should easily make up for.

> As for OS, definitely Linux. I use Mint and it works for me, but Ubuntu or any other similar flavour is also fine. Just pick a big one so if you have any issues it is easy to find solutions on google.
